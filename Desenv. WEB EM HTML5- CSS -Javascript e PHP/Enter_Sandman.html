<p>Say your prayers, little one<br>
Don't forget, my son<br>
To include everyone<br>
I tuck you in, warm within<br>
Keep you free from sin<br>
Till the sandman he comes<p><br>

<p>Sleep with one eye open<br>
Gripping your pillow tight<br>
Exit light<br>
Enter night<br>
Take my hand<br>
We're off to Never-never Land<p><br>

<p>Something's wrong, shut the light<br>
Heavy thoughts tonight<br>
And they aren't of Snow White<br>
Dreams of war, dreams of liars<br>
Dreams of dragon's fire<br>
And of things that will bite<br>
Yeah<p><br>
Sleep with one eye open<br>
Gripping your pillow tight<br>
Exit light<br>
Enter night<br>
Take my hand<br>
We're off to Never-never Land<p><br>

<p>Now I lay me down to sleep<br>
Pray the Lord my soul to keep<br>
If I die before I wake<br>
Pray the Lord my soul to take<br>
Hush, little baby, don't say a word<br>
And never mind that noise you heard<br>
It's just the beasts under your bed<br>
In your closet, in your head<p><br>

<p>Exit light<br>
Enter night<br>
Grain of sand<br>
Exit light<br>
Enter night<br>
Take my hand<br>
We're off to Never-never Land<p><br>

<p>Oh<br>
Yeah, yeah<br>
Woah, woah<br>
Take my hand<br>
We're off to Never-never Land<br>
Take my hand<br>
We're off to Never-never Land<br>
